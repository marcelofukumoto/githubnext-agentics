# ✨ The Agentics

A sample family of reusable [GitHub Agentic Workflows](https://github.github.com/gh-aw/).

## 📂 Available Workflows

### Triage Workflows

- [🏷️ Issue Triage](docs/issue-triage.md) - Triage issues and pull requests

### Fault Analysis Workflows

- [🏥 CI Doctor](docs/ci-doctor.md) - Monitor CI workflows and investigate failures automatically
- [🚀 CI Coach](docs/ci-coach.md) - Optimize CI workflows for speed and cost efficiency

### Code Review Workflows

- [✅ Contribution Guidelines Checker](docs/contribution-guidelines-checker.md) - Review pull requests for compliance with contribution guidelines
- [😤 Grumpy Reviewer](docs/grumpy-reviewer.md) - On-demand opinionated code review by a grumpy but thorough senior developer

### Research, Status & Planning Workflows

- [📚 Weekly Research](docs/weekly-research.md) - Collect research updates and industry trends
- [📊 Weekly Issue Summary](docs/weekly-issue-summary.md) - Weekly issue activity report with trend charts and recommendations
- [👥 Daily Repo Status](docs/daily-repo-status.md) - Assess repository activity and create status reports
- [👥 Daily Team Status](docs/daily-team-status.md) - Create upbeat daily team activity summaries with productivity insights
- [📋 Daily Plan](docs/daily-plan.md) - Update planning issues for team coordination

### Dependency Management Workflows

- [📦 Dependabot PR Bundler](docs/dependabot-pr-bundler.md) - Create pull requests to bundle together as many dependabot updates as possible
- [📦 Dependabot Issue Bundler](docs/dependabot-issue-bundler.md) - Create issues that group together dependabot updates related to the same ecosystem

### Command-Triggered Agentic Workflows

These workflows are triggered by specific "/" commands in issue or pull request comments, allowing for on-demand agentic assistance. Only maintainers or those with write access can trigger these workflows by commenting with the appropriate command.

- [📋 Plan Command](docs/plan.md) - Break down issues into actionable sub-tasks with /plan command
- [🏥 PR Fix](docs/pr-fix.md) - Analyze failing CI checks and implement fixes for pull requests
- [🔍 Repo Ask](docs/repo-ask.md) - Intelligent research assistant for repository questions and analysis

### Code Improvement Workflows (by analysis, producing report)

These workflows analyze the repository, code, and activity to produce reports, insights, and recommendations for improvements. They do not make any changes to the codebase directly but can be used as input for maintainers to take action.

You can use the "/plan" agent to turn the reports into actionable issues which can then be assigned to the appropriate team members or agents.

- [🔍 Daily Accessibility Review](docs/daily-accessibility-review.md) - Review application accessibility by automatically running and using the application
- [🔎 Daily Adhoc QA](docs/daily-qa.md) - Perform adhoc explorative quality assurance tasks
