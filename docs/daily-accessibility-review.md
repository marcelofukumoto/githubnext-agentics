The [daily accessibility review workflow](../workflows/daily-accessibility-review.md?plain=1) will perform accessibility reviews of the application.

## Installation

## Configuration

This workflow requires no configuration and works out of the box.

After editing run `gh aw compile` to update the workflow and commit all changes to the default branch.

## What it reads from GitHub

- Repository contents and source code for accessibility analysis

## What it creates

- Creates new issues documenting accessibility problems found
- Requires `issues: write` permission

## What web searches it performs

- May look up accessibility best practices and compliance requirements

## Human in the loop

- Validate accessibility problems with screen readers or accessibility tools
- Prioritize accessibility fixes based on severity and impact
- Test accessibility improvements before closing issues
- Disable or uninstall the workflow if accessibility reports are not accurate or useful
