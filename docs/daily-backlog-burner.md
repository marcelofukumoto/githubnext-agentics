# 🔥 Daily Backlog Burner

> For an overview of all available workflows, see the [main README](../README.md).

The [daily backlog burner workflow](../workflows/daily-backlog-burner.md?plain=1) performs systematic backlog management by working through issues and pull requests. It operates in two phases: first researching the entire backlog to categorize and prioritize items, then systematically closing, resolving, or advancing selected items. Creates discussions to track progress and gather maintainer feedback, helping reduce technical debt.

## Installation

```bash
# Install the 'gh aw' extension
gh extension install github/gh-aw

# Add the workflow to your repository
gh aw add-wizard githubnext/agentics/daily-backlog-burner
```

This walks you through adding the workflow to your repository.

You can start a run of this workflow immediately by running:

```bash
gh aw run daily-backlog-burner
```

## How It Works

````mermaid
graph LR
    A[Research Backlog] --> B[Categorize Items]
    B --> C[Prioritize]
    C --> D{Action Needed?}
    D -->|Close| E[Close Stale Items]
    D -->|Fix| F[Create Draft PR]
    D -->|Discuss| G[Create Discussion]
````

## Configuration

This workflow requires no configuration and works out of the box. It will automatically analyze your backlog and suggest items for closure or resolution. You can edit it to customize prioritization criteria and decision-making logic.

After editing run `gh aw compile` to update the workflow and commit all changes to the default branch.

## What it reads from GitHub

- All open issues, pull requests, and their metadata
- Issue and PR comments, labels, and activity history
- Repository policies and contribution guidelines
- Discussions and community feedback

## What it creates

- Creates discussions in the "Ideas" category to propose backlog cleanup strategies
- Adds comments to issues and PRs explaining proposed actions
- Creates draft pull requests to address backlog items
- Requires `issues: write`, `pull-requests: write`, and `discussions: write` permissions

## Human in the loop

- Review discussions created by the workflow to validate backlog cleanup proposals
- Provide feedback on prioritization decisions and item categorization
- Approve or reject proposed closures or resolutions through discussion comments
- Monitor the workflow's progress and adjust its strategy as needed
- Disable or uninstall the workflow if backlog management becomes too aggressive
