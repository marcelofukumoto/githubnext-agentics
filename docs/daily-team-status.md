# 👥 Daily Team Status

> For an overview of all available workflows, see the [main README](../README.md).

The [daily team status workflow](../workflows/daily-team-status.md?plain=1) creates daily team status reports with upbeat activity summaries. It gathers recent repository activity (issues, PRs, discussions, releases, code changes) and generates engaging GitHub issues with productivity insights, community highlights, and project recommendations. Uses a positive, encouraging tone with moderate emoji usage to boost team morale.

## Installation

```bash
# Install the 'gh aw' extension
gh extension install github/gh-aw

# Add the workflow to your repository
gh aw add-wizard githubnext/agentics/daily-team-status
```

This walks you through adding the workflow to your repository.

You can start a run of this workflow immediately by running:

```bash
gh aw run daily-team-status
```

## Configuration

This workflow requires no configuration and works out of the box. It will automatically gather repository activity and create daily status reports. You can edit it to customize the tone, included metrics, and reporting frequency.

After editing run `gh aw compile` to update the workflow and commit all changes to the default branch.
