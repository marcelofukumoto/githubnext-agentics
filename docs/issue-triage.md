# 🏷️ Issue Triage

> For an overview of all available workflows, see the [main README](../README.md).

The [issue triage workflow](../workflows/issue-triage.md?plain=1) will run when issues are created or reopened to triage issues in the repository.

## Installation

```bash
# Install the 'gh aw' extension
gh extension install github/gh-aw

# Add the workflow to your repository
gh aw add-wizard githubnext/agentics/issue-triage
```

This walks you through adding the workflow to your repository.

You must also [choose a coding agent](https://github.github.com/gh-aw/reference/engines/) and add an API key secret for the agent to your repository.

You can't start a run of this workflow directly as it is triggered in the context of an issue.

## How It Works

````mermaid

    A[Issue Created/Reopened] --> B[Analyze Content]
    B --> C[Check Related Items]
    C --> D[Categorize Issue]
    D --> E[Add Labels]
    E --> F[Post Triage Comment]
````

## Configuration

This workflow requires no configuration and works out of the box. You can edit it to customize triage criteria, labeling logic, customize issue categorization, modify automated responses.

After editing run `gh aw compile` to update the workflow and commit all changes to the default branch.
