# 🔧 Q - Agentic Workflow Optimizer

> For an overview of all available workflows, see the [main README](../README.md).

The [Q workflow](../workflows/q.md?plain=1) is a command-triggered workflow that acts as an expert system for optimizing and fixing agentic workflows. It provides agents with the best tools and configurations for their tasks. When invoked with the `q` command, it analyzes workflow performance, identifies missing tools, detects inefficiencies, and creates pull requests with optimized configurations.

You can trigger the workflow by adding a comment to any issue or pull request with the command:

```
/q
```

or by writing a comment with a specific request:

```
/q Analyze and optimize all workflows in this repository
```

## How It Works

    A[/q Command] --> B[Analyze Workflows]

````

## Installation

```bash
# Install the 'gh aw' extension
gh extension install github/gh-aw

# Add the workflow to your repository
gh aw add-wizard githubnext/agentics/q
```

This walks you through adding the workflow to your repository.

You can't start a run of this workflow directly as it is triggered in the context of an issue or pull request comment.

To trigger the workflow on a specific issue or pull request, add a comment with the command:

```text
/q [your optimization request here]
```

## Configuration

This workflow requires no configuration and works out of the box. You can customize optimization behavior and analysis scope if needed by editing the workflow file.

After editing run `gh aw compile` to update the workflow and commit all changes to the default branch.

## What it reads from GitHub

- Workflow files and configurations in `workflows/` directory
- Actions workflow runs, logs, and audit information
- Issue or pull request context where the command was triggered
- Repository structure and shared workflow configurations
- Workflow execution history and performance metrics

## What it creates

- Pull requests with workflow optimizations (if changes are needed)
- Comments with analysis findings and recommendations

## What web searches it performs

- Searches for GitHub Actions agentic workflow best practices
- Looks up tool documentation for missing or misconfigured tools
- Researches performance optimization strategies
- Finds solutions for identified error patterns

## What bash commands it runs

- File inspection commands to analyze workflow files
- Directory traversal to find workflow configurations
- Text processing to identify patterns and issues
- Any other commands needed to analyze workflow structure

## Use Cases

- **Performance Optimization**: Identify and fix workflows with high token usage or excessive turns
- **Missing Tools**: Detect and add missing tools that workflows attempt to use
- **Permission Issues**: Fix workflows with insufficient permissions
- **Pattern Extraction**: Create shared configurations for common workflow patterns
- **Error Analysis**: Investigate recurring workflow failures and propose fixes
- **Configuration Improvements**: Add timeouts limits, and other best practice settings

## Example Commands

```
/q Analyze all workflows and suggest optimizations
/q Fix the missing tools in the daily-progress workflow
/q Investigate why the CI doctor workflow is failing
/q Extract common patterns from coding workflows into a shared config
/q Add missing permissions to workflows that have errors
/q Optimize workflows with high token usage
/q Review and improve workflow timeout settings
```

## How It Works

1. **Context Analysis**: Parses the triggering comment to understand what needs optimization
2. **Data Gathering**: Downloads recent workflow logs and audit information using the agentic-workflows tool
3. **Code Analysis**: Examines workflow files to identify issues and patterns
4. **Research**: Uses web search to find solutions and best practices
5. **Improvements**: Makes targeted changes to workflow files
6. **Validation**: Validates changes using the compile tool
7. **Pull Request**: Creates a PR with optimizations (or comments if no changes needed)

## Human in the loop

- Review the analysis and findings before accepting optimizations
- Validate that suggested changes align with your workflow requirements
- Test workflow changes in a development environment before merging
- Provide feedback on optimization recommendations
