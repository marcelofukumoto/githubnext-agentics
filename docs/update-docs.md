# 📖 Regular Documentation Update

> For an overview of all available workflows, see the [main README](../README.md).

The [update documentation workflow](../workflows/update-docs.md?plain=1) will run on each push to main to try to update documentation in the repository. It defaults to using [Astro Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build) for documentation generation, but you can edit it to use other frameworks if necessary.

## Installation

```bash
# Install the 'gh aw' extension
gh extension install github/gh-aw

# Add the workflow to your repository
gh aw add-wizard githubnext/agentics/update-docs
```

This walks you through adding the workflow to your repository.

You can start a run of this workflow immediately by running:

```bash
gh aw run update-docs
```

## How It Works

````mermaid
graph LR
    A[Push to Main] --> B[Analyze Changes]
    B --> C[Generate Docs]
    C --> D{Updates Needed?}
    D -->|Yes| E[Create Doc Branch]
    E --> F[Create PR]
    D -->|No| G[Report: Docs Current]
````

## Configuration

This workflow requires no configuration and works out of the box. You can configure documentation frameworks, documentation structure, themes, files, directories by editing the workflow file.

After editing run `gh aw compile` to update the workflow and commit all changes to the default branch.

## Human in the loop
